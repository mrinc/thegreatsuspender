    <h1>The Great Suspender has been updated</h1>

    <hr class="splashRule" />

    <h2>Bugs squashed</h2>
    <p>This new version fixes the bug caused by the new chrome release that caused tabs to change the the wrong url when they were suspended.
    Sorry for such a terrible bug and that the fix was a long time coming.</p>
    <p>The 'suspend other tabs' option will now NOT suspend the currently active tab.</p>
    <p>Browsing in incognito mode will no longer bring up the welcome tab every time.</p>

    <h2>What's new?</h2>
    <p>This version includes light and dark themes. Try switching to the dark theme when using chrome at night to go easy on your eyes.</p>
    <p>The extension now supports actions on multiple selected tabs. If you select multiple tabs in chrome, you will have some new options appear
    in the pop-up menu to allow you to suspend / unsuspend all selected tabs</p>
    <p>The new improved whitelist now supports regular expressions. For the programming-minded only!</p>
    <p>You can check it all out in the <a href='/options.html' target='_blank'>settings</a> page.</p>

    <h2>Problems with the update?</h2>
    <p>If you are experiencing a loss of tabs due to this update, try going to the <a href='/history.html' target='_blank'>session management</a> page. You will find a list of all your recently suspended tabs and should be able to recover them from here.</p>

    <p>If losing your tabs has made you extremely upset and you want to uninstall this extension: fair enough - but before you do, please go through the session recovery process first and make sure all your tabs are recovered and unsuspended before you uninstall.</p>

    <p>Thanks for using <strong>The Great Suspender!</strong></p>
